## Parser and Lexer Coverage (User Concern Resolved)

**User Issue**: "The lexer and parser are shown as untested and I would think that the torture tests would have covered most of it."

**Resolution**: The previous incomplete report only included FLua.Runtime.LibraryTests. The complete report shows:

### FLua.Parser Assembly Coverage
- **Overall Parser Assembly**: 38.4% line coverage (152/395 lines), 16.7% branch coverage
- **FLua.Parser.Parser**: 43.7% line coverage (122/279 lines), 21.1% branch coverage
- **FLua.Parser.Lexer**: 0% line coverage (0/67 lines), 0% branch coverage  
- **FLua.Parser.ParserHelper**: 61.2% line coverage (30/49 lines), 42.8% branch coverage

**Analysis**: 
- The Parser itself has substantial coverage (43.7%) from torture tests and other test projects
- The Lexer shows 0% coverage, which may indicate F# coverage tracking issues or that the Lexer is tested indirectly
- ParserHelper has good coverage (61.2%)
