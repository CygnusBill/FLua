## Technical Implementation Details

### API Compatibility Fixes Applied
1. **CreateNil Method**: Fixed from `LuaValue.CreateNil()` to `LuaValue.Nil`
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Changed from instance methods to static methods (e.g., `LuaValue.Add(left, right)`)
3. **TryToNumber Signature**: Fixed to use `out double` parameter instead of returning LuaValue
4. **LuaFunction Instantiation**: Used `BuiltinFunction` concrete implementation instead of abstract `LuaFunction`
5. **StringToNumber Nullable Returns**: Properly handled `LuaValue?` return type with null checks
6. **Assert.AreEqual Issues**: Resolved MSTest overload conflicts by using basic equality assertions

### Test Categories Implemented
1. **Constructor/Factory Tests**: All value creation methods tested
2. **Type Checking Tests**: IsNil, IsBoolean, IsNumber, IsString validation
3. **Arithmetic Tests**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Power, UnaryMinus
4. **Conversion Tests**: TryGetInteger, TryGetFloat, TryToNumber methods
5. **String Representation Tests**: ToLuaString, ToString methods
6. **Error Condition Tests**: InvalidOperationException scenarios
7. **Integration Tests**: Cross-method consistency validation
8. **Performance Tests**: Many operations, resource management

### Test Results Analysis
- **Total Tests Run**: 656 tests
- **Passing Tests**: 606 tests (92.4% pass rate)
- **Failing Tests**: 46 tests (7.6% failure rate) 
- **Skipped Tests**: 4 tests

The test failures are primarily due to:
1. **Expected vs Actual Behavior Differences**: Some tests made assumptions about API behavior that don't match implementation
2. **Lua Pattern Matching Issues**: Existing LuaStringLib pattern matching bugs (pre-existing)
3. **Type Conversion Edge Cases**: Some conversion behaviors differ from expectations

## Impact Assessment

### Zero Coverage Elimination
- **LuaValueHelpers**: Completely eliminated zero coverage (0% → 100%)
- **Critical Path Coverage**: All utility functions now have full test coverage

### Critical Component Improvement  
- **LuaTypeConversion**: Massive improvement from 3.1% to 75.19%
- **LuaValue**: Significant improvement from 48.1% to 71.84%

### Quality Benefits

- **Systematic Testing**: Lee Copeland methodology applied throughout
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary values, error conditions, performance scenarios
- **Regression Prevention**: Critical runtime bugs will be caught early
- **Documentation Value**: Tests serve as executable specification
