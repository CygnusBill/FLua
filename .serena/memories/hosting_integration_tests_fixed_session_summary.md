# Hosting Integration Tests Fixed - Session Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed comprehensive test fixing session for FLua hosting system. Fixed all 11 hosting integration test failures through systematic analysis and implementation of proper security model and environment handling.

## Primary Accomplishment
**All hosting integration tests now pass**: 106 passed, 0 failed, 4 intentionally skipped

## Key Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Security-Aware Library Loading
- Modified `LuaEnvironment.CreateStandardEnvironment()` to accept optional `trustLevel` parameter
- Implemented conditional library loading based on trust levels:
  - **Untrusted (0)**: Only math and string libraries
  - **Sandbox (1+)**: Adds table, coroutine, UTF8 libraries  
  - **Restricted (2+)**: Adds io, os libraries (with filtering)
  - **Trusted (3+)**: Full standard library except debug
  - **FullTrust (4)**: All libraries including debug

### 2. Object-to-LuaValue Conversion Fix
- Fixed `ConvertObjectToTable()` in `FilteredEnvironmentProvider`
- Properly wrap `ObjectFacadeTable` with `LuaValue.Table()` call
- Enables anonymous object injection into Lua environments

### 3. Module Environment Handling
- Applied same fix as `LuaHost.ExecuteInternal` to module execution
- Rebuild evaluators with correct environment instead of using reflection
- Ensures module environments properly inherit from parent environments

### 4. Generic For Loop Multi-Value Support
- Fixed `StatementExecutor` to handle multiple return values from iterators
- Used `SelectMany()` to properly flatten iterator results
- Enables `ipairs()` and `pairs()` to work correctly in for loops

### 5. Pattern Matching Fixes
- Fixed capture group quantifier detection logic
- Added quantifier handling to parenthesis closing cases
- Corrected REPL multi-statement evaluation behavior

## Files Modified

### Core Runtime
- `/Users/bill/Repos/FLua/FLua.Runtime/LuaEnvironment.cs`
  - Added trust-level based library loading
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### Hosting System  
- `/Users/bill/Repos/FLua/FLua.Hosting/Environment/FilteredEnvironmentProvider.cs`
  - Fixed object-to-table conversion wrapper
  - Improved module execution environment handling
  
- `/Users/bill/Repos/FLua/FLua.Hosting/LuaHost.cs`  
  - Applied evaluator rebuilding pattern consistently

### Interpreter
- `/Users/bill/Repos/FLua/FLua.Interpreter/StatementExecutor.cs`
  - Enhanced generic for loop handling
  
- `/Users/bill/Repos/FLua/FLua.Runtime/LuaPatterns.cs`
  - Fixed pattern matching capture groups

## Test Results Summary
- **Hosting Tests**: 106 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped ✅
- **Runtime Tests**: 131 passed, 0 failed ✅ 
- **Parser Tests**: 266 passed, 0 failed ✅
- **Compiler Tests**: 12 passed, 0 failed ✅
- **CLI Tests**: 22 passed, 0 failed ✅

### Remaining Issues (Other Test Suites)
- **Library Tests**: 1 failure (optional capture group - existing issue)
- **Variable Attributes**: 1 failure (const parameter validation)
- **Interpreter Tests**: 1 failure (REPL function definition)

Total: **943 tests passed**, 3 failed in non-hosting suites

## Architecture Insights

### Module Environment Problem Resolution
The core issue was that the `LuaInterpreter` creates `ExpressionEvaluator` and `StatementExecutor` with default constructor, which uses a default environment. When modules were loaded, setting the interpreter's environment via reflection didn't update the evaluators.

**Solution**: Rebuild evaluators with the correct environment instead of trying to modify private fields post-construction.

### Security Model Implementation
Implemented proper trust-level based filtering that matches Lua hosting requirements:
- Library availability based on security levels
- Function filtering within environments
- Module resolution restrictions by trust level

### Object Interop Enhancement
Fixed .NET object injection into Lua environments, enabling seamless host context sharing with proper type conversion and table facade patterns.

## Development Patterns Established
1. **Environment-First Design**: Always consider environment setup before evaluator creation
2. **Security-Aware Components**: All hosting components now respect trust levels
3. **Proper Wrapping**: Always use appropriate `LuaValue.X()` wrappers for type conversions
4. **Multi-Value Awareness**: Handle Lua's multiple return values consistently

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)
- Cancellation token support (deferred - needs better design)
- Remaining test failures in other suites
- Performance optimization for compiled modules
