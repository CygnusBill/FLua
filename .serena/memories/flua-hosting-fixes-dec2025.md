# FLua Hosting Module Fixes - December 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical issues in the FLua hosting module, improving test pass rate from 91/110 to 94/110.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Module Execution Environment Setup ✅
**Problem**: Modules were not executing in the correct environment, causing failures when modules tried to access global functions like `require`.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `ExecuteModule` in `FilteredEnvironmentProvider` to properly create child environments
- Module environment now inherits from the parent environment, allowing access to globals
- Used reflection to set interpreter environment (should add proper constructor later)

### 2. Nested Module Requires ✅
**Problem**: Modules that required other modules were failing because the require function wasn't available in module scope.

**Solution**:
- Module environment now properly inherits the parent environment including the require function
- Each module gets its own environment that can see parent scope

### 3. Sandbox Trust Level Module Loading ✅
**Problem**: Sandbox trust level was removing the `require` function entirely and path checking was too restrictive.

**Solutions**:
- Modified `FilteredEnvironmentByTrustLevel` to not remove `require` for Sandbox level (it gets replaced with controlled version)
- Fixed `IsInSandboxPath` to allow any path within configured search paths rather than requiring specific directory names

## Architectural Limitations Documented

Created `ARCHITECTURAL_LIMITATIONS.md` documenting:
- Expression tree compilation limitations (no function definitions)
- Module compilation with closures constraints
- Security model considerations
- Interpreter environment limitations
- Compilation target differences from standard Lua

## Test Results After Fixes

### Before:
- 91 passing, 5 failing, 14 skipped

### After:
- 94 passing, 2 failing, 14 skipped

### Remaining Failures:
1. `CompileToExpression_ComplexCalculation_EvaluatesCorrectly` - Uses function definition (architectural limitation)
2. `CompileToExpression_TableOperations_WorksWithTables` - Uses function definition (architectural limitation)

### Fixed Tests:
1. `TestModuleCompilation_WithCaching_ReusesCompiledModule` ✅
2. `TestModuleCompilation_WithUntrustedLevel_UsesInterpreter` ✅
3. `TestModuleCompilation_NestedRequires_Work` ✅

## Code Changes

### FilteredEnvironmentProvider.cs
- Fixed `ExecuteModule` to properly set up module environment
- Modified `FilterEnvironmentByTrustLevel` to keep `require` for Sandbox level

### FileSystemModuleResolver.cs
- Fixed `IsInSandboxPath` to check if path is within configured search paths
- More reasonable security model for Sandbox trust level

## Next Steps

1. **Add proper constructor to LuaInterpreter** that accepts environment parameter
2. **Mark expression tree tests** as expected failures or rewrite within constraints
3. **Review skipped tests** to see if any can be enabled
4. **Consider caching improvements** for compiled modules
