## High Priority

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Add AOT/standalone executable support (PublishSingleFile, self-contained)
- [ ] Implement load() function for dynamic code loading
- [ ] Design and implement structured error/warning system
- [ ] Improved error messages with line numbers
- [ ] Add IL.Emit backend for size optimization

## Low Priority
- [ ] Review parser ordering and overlapping conditions
- [ ] Add Lua bytecode backend
- [ ] Implement sandboxing configuration
- [ ] Fix _ENV = nil handling in modules
- [ ] Improved warning messages

## Notes
- Console app support helps with testing - we can now compile and run standalone programs
- All 24 compiler tests are passing in FLua.Compiler.Tests.Minimal (including inline functions)
- RoslynCodeGenerator is the preferred implementation (syntax factory based)
- CSharpCodeGenerator kept for reference but could be removed
- Control structures implemented: if/elseif/else, while, repeat/until, numeric for, generic for, break
- Assignment statements now support both local and non-local variables
- Unary operators implemented for proper handling of negative numbers in for loops
- Parser fixes enable full table support: assignment (t[1] = 100) and expressions (t[1] + t[2])
- Inline function expressions supported (function() ... end) with proper code generation
- Note: Closures not yet supported (accessing outer scope variables from inner functions)
